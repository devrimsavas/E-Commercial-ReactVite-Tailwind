# E-Commercial App

**Very important note please read**:
To ensure the proper functioning of the Admin Panel in the FRONT-END section, it is crucial to configure the token secrets consistently across both folders. This configuration is essential for the smooth operation of the front-end admin panel.

- after you have installed npm module

```bash
npm install
```

generate a token secret using Node's crypto module:

```bash
require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex')
```

and add this `generated_token_secret`for both env module in front and back-end env files.

# Node version

This application uses node version v20.10.0. Please check your node version using in command line:

```bash
node --version
```
